# CoreML and Vision object detection and classification
 This project shows how to use CoreML and Vison with an pretrained SSD model. There are many variations of SSD. The one weâ€™re going to use is MobileNet V2 as the backbone this model also has separable convolutions for the SSD layers, also known as SSDLite.
 This app can find the locations of several different types of objects in the image. The detections are described by bounding boxes, and for each bounding box the model also predicts a class.
