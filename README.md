# CoreML and Vision object detection with a pretrained deep learning SSD model

 This project shows how to use CoreML and Vision with a pretrained deep learning SSD model. There are many variations of SSD. The one weâ€™re going to use is MobileNetV2 as the backbone this model also has separable convolutions for the SSD layers, also known as SSDLite.
 This app can find the locations of several different types of objects in the image. The detections are described by bounding boxes, and for each bounding box the model also predicts a class.

## Side Note
* Currently, I do not have an iPhone, so I'm unable to test the app on a physical device. I apologize in advance for maybe possible bugs.

   Kind regards,

## Requirements
- Physical device! Because the simulator does not have a camera
- Swift 4.2
- Xcode 9.2+
- iOS 11.0+

## Auto genereted model helper class
Once the model is imported the compiler generates a model helper class on build path automatically.Then we can access the model through model helper class by creating an instance.

## Model Metadata
Here we can see the inputs the model aspects and the outputs it generates, as well as auto genereted model helper class.

## Camera Usage Description
Add permission in info.plist for device's camera access

Or you can open the info.plist file as raw XML and add the following code:

```swift
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
      <string>Camera Needed For Object Detection And Classification</string>

```
